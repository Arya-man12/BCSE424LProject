Our project is a sign language conversation system using a robotic hand run by esp32 and a raspberry pi 4b
1. Hearing impaired user uses sign language to communicate.
2. AI model converts  sign language representation into text input.
3. A second user may either respond to the text input,or the text is sent to an AI via API call.
4. The response is translated into sign language using the robotic hand.
